## API Integration

The repository supports integration with various APIs, including the CryptoCompare API. This allows you to fetch cryptocurrency data such as prices, market cap, and trading volume.

### Example Usage

Here is a simple example of how to fetch cryptocurrency data:

const cryptoCompare = require('cryptocompare');

async function getCryptoData() {
    const data = await cryptoCompare.price('BTC', ['USD', 'EUR']);
    console.log(data);
}

getCryptoData();
```

## SchemaSafe Seed Management

Managing your seed phrases securely is crucial for any cryptocurrency wallet. This repository implements SchemaSafe for secure seed storage. 

### How It Works

SchemaSafe encrypts your seed phrases, ensuring they are stored safely. You can easily retrieve and use them when needed.

### Example

To store a seed phrase:

```javascript
const schemaSafe = require('schemasafe');

const seedPhrase = 'your seed phrase here';
const encryptedSeed = schemaSafe.encrypt(seedPhrase);
```

To retrieve the seed phrase:

```javascript
const decryptedSeed = schemaSafe.decrypt(encryptedSeed);
```

## CryptoCompare API Support

The CryptoCompare API provides extensive data on various cryptocurrencies. This repository allows you to integrate this data into your applications easily.

### Key Endpoints

- **Price**: Get the current price of a cryptocurrency.
- **Historical Data**: Fetch historical data for price analysis.
- **Market Data**: Access information on market cap and trading volume.

### Example

To get historical data:

```javascript
const historicalData = await cryptoCompare.histoDay('BTC', { currency: 'USD', limit: 30 });
console.log(historicalData);
```

## Web3 and WalletConnect Compatibility

This repository supports Web3 and WalletConnect, making it easy to connect to decentralized applications.

### Web3 Integration

You can interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications using Web3.js.

### WalletConnect

WalletConnect allows users to connect their wallets to mobile applications securely. 

### Example

To set up WalletConnect:

```javascript
import WalletConnect from "@walletconnect/client";

const connector = new WalletConnect({
    bridge: "https://bridge.walletconnect.org", // Required
});

if (!connector.connected) {
    await connector.createSession();
}

// Subscribe to connection events
connector.on("connect", (error, payload) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }

    // Get provided accounts and chainId
    const { accounts, chainId } = payload.params[0];
});
```
